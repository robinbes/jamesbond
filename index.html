    <h1>James Bond</h1>
    <p>The James Bond series focuses on a fictional British Secret Service agent created in <time>1953</time> by writer <strong><a href="ian-fleming.html">Ian Fleming</a></strong>, who featured him in twelve novels and two short-story collections. Since Fleming's death in <time>1964</time>, eight other authors have written authorised Bond novels or novelizations: Kingsley Amis, Christopher Wood, John Gardner, Raymond Benson, Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver, William Boyd and Anthony Horowitz. The latest novel is Trigger Mortis by Anthony Horowitz, published in <time>September 2015</time>. Additionally Charlie Higson wrote a series on a young James Bond, and Kate Westbrook wrote three novels based on the diaries of a recurring series character, Moneypenny.</p>

<p>The character has also been adapted for television, radio, comic strip, video games and film. The films are the longest continually running and the third-highest-grossing film series to date, which started in <time>1962</time> with Dr. No, starring Sean Connery as Bond. As of <time>2016</time>, there have been twenty-four films in the Eon Productions series. The most recent Bond film, Spectre (<time>2015</time>), stars Daniel Craig in his fourth portrayal of Bond; he is the sixth actor to play Bond in the Eon series. There have also been two independent productions of Bond films: Casino Royale (a <time>1967</time> spoof) and Never Say Never Again (a <time>1983</time> remake of an earlier Eon-produced film, Thunderball).</p>

<p>The Bond films are renowned for a number of features, including the musical accompaniment, with the theme songs having received Academy Award nominations on several occasions, and two wins.
